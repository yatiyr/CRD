# Cerid — Open Debt

Items that are not blockers but should not be forgotten. When picked up,
move to a session log entry and remove from here.

## Active debt

_(none — all items cleared as of 2026-05-03)_

## Long-term deferred

- **Multi-viewport ImGui** — Vulkan multi-viewport has known rough edges.
  Single-viewport docking only until `crd-ui` ships (planned Phase 5+).
  At that point, game/editor surfaces move to `crd-ui`; ImGui stays debug-only
  and multi-viewport is no longer needed.

## GPU instancing (planned Phase 3.2)

v1h ships `draw_indexed(index_count, first_index, vertex_offset)` — non-instanced only
(`instance_count` hardwired to 1 in the Vulkan call). When instancing lands:

**RHI changes:**
- Add `draw_instanced(vertex_count, instance_count, first_vertex, first_instance)` to
  `CommandBuffer` (non-indexed instanced path).
- Add `draw_indexed_instanced(index_count, instance_count, first_index, vertex_offset, first_instance)`
  to `CommandBuffer` (indexed instanced path, mirrors `vkCmdDrawIndexed` fully).
- All four draw variants (`draw`, `draw_indexed`, `draw_instanced`, `draw_indexed_instanced`)
  coexist; `VulkanCommandBuffer` implements all four.

**Renderer changes:**
- `Renderable` and `DrawItem` gain `instance_count = 1` (default keeps backward compat).
- `ForwardRenderPath` dispatch logic: `instance_count == 1` → non-instanced path (no
  regression); `instance_count > 1` → instanced path.
- GPU instance data buffer (transforms, material indices) is a Phase 3 GPU scene buffer
  concern — `crd-resources` provides per-frame upload; `ForwardRenderPath` binds it as
  a storage buffer at set 0 binding 1 or via push constants for the base instance.

**When:** After Phase 3.1 (stable entity/transform storage in the scene system) ships and
a GPU instance data layout is frozen. Instancing without a stable instance buffer contract
produces nothing useful. Target: Phase 3.2.

**Do NOT prematurely add `instance_count` to `Renderable` / `DrawItem` before that point.**

## Renderer optimization backlog (post-v1g)

Intentionally deferred. These require the render path to be working end-to-end
before they pay off. Implement in order of demonstrated need, not in anticipation.

- **Transient image aliasing in the frame graph** — `FrameGraph::execute` currently
  creates transient images fresh each frame and destroys them on `reset()`. A proper
  aliasing pass would reuse GPU heap pages across mutually-exclusive transients,
  reducing VRAM by the sum of the largest non-overlapping resource sets. Prerequisite:
  lifetime analysis pass in `FrameGraph::build()`.

- **HDR render target** — `ForwardRenderPath` uses `B8G8R8A8Unorm` (LDR). Switch to
  `R16G16B16A16Sfloat` (scene linear HDR) and add a tone-map pass before the swapchain
  blit. Required before bloom, exposure, or any physically-based lighting integral.

- **Depth-only pipeline for the depth prepass** — `ForwardRenderPath` v1g reuses the
  full vertex+fragment pipeline in the depth prepass. A vertex-only pipeline (null
  fragment shader, `Format::Undefined` color, `Format::D32Sfloat` depth only) removes
  unnecessary fragment work during the prepass. Requires the per-variant pipeline cache
  to store `{depth_pipeline, color_pipeline}` pairs.

- **Async pipeline compilation** — `PipelineResolver::resolve_pipeline()` is currently
  synchronous. Slow variant compiles stall the main thread. Solution: compile on a job
  thread, return a "pending" sentinel, and render with a fallback pipeline until the
  real one is ready. Integrates with `crd-jobs` (Phase 2.5).

- **Bindless material system** — Current: one descriptor set per material instance per
  frame (set 1), allocated from the ring pool. Future: global bindless descriptor heap
  (one giant `DescriptorSet` with an array of all textures + material CBs), indexed
  via a per-draw material index in the push constants. Eliminates per-draw
  `vkCmdBindDescriptorSets` calls. Requires Vulkan device features: `descriptorIndexing`.

- **GPU-driven rendering** — CPU culling + indirect draw. Replace per-object draw calls
  with a compute dispatch that reads a scene buffer, outputs `VkDrawIndirectCommand`
  structs, and optionally writes a visible-object list. Requires: stable GPU scene buffer
  (Phase 3 scene system), `VkDrawIndirectCount` (Vulkan 1.2 core), and a GPU frustum
  cull shader. Significant throughput gain for dense scenes (> ~10k draws).

- **Split vertex streams** — Separate position-only VBO from full-attribute VBO. The
  depth prepass only needs positions; pulling the full vertex (UVs, normals, tangents)
  wastes memory bandwidth. Requires `DrawItem` to carry both VBOs and shader variants to
  declare which stream they consume.

## Cleared debt

- **Disabled-trace benchmark** (2026-05-03) — Replaced compile-time-eliminated
  `CRD_LOG_TRACE` call with `CRD_LOG_INFO` gated by `runtime_level = Error`. The
  benchmark now measures the runtime short-circuit cost in all build configurations.
- **Doxygen per-symbol comments in crd-core** (2026-05-03) — Added `///` docs to all
  symbols in `types.hpp` (14 aliases), `platform.hpp` (18 macros + 3 functions), and
  `assert.hpp` (2 type aliases + 4 functions + 4 macros).
- **No SPSC RingBuffer** (2026-05-03) — Added `SpscQueue<T>` in
  `engine/containers/include/crd/containers/spsc_queue.hpp`. Lock-free, cache-line
  padded head/tail atomics, wait-free push and pop. Tested single-threaded and with
  concurrent 1M-item producer/consumer.
- **No file watcher in crd-platform** (2026-05-03) — Added polling-based `FileWatcher`
  in `engine/platform/`. Uses `fs::last_modified_unix_seconds()` on each polled path.
  Handles add/remove by handle, fires callbacks synchronously in `poll()`.
- **Multi-viewport ImGui deferred** (2026-05-03) — Moved to "Long-term deferred" above.
  Will not land until `crd-ui` ships; ImGui stays debug-only forever.
